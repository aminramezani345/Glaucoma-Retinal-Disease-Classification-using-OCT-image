# MULTIPLE-Retinal-Disease-Classification-using-OCT-image

This repository presents an innovative approach that combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Attention-guided CNNs**, and **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** for precise eye disease detection from retinal images. The **Attention-guided CNN** extracts disease-specific features, which are then used to fine-tune a **Vision Transformer** for classification. This integrated process results in highly accurate and robust disease detection.

1. **Attention-guided CNNs**  
   A CNN model incorporating **spatial attention mechanisms** to enhance the focus on key spatial regions of the input images.

2. **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**  
   Vision Transformer (ViT) implementation that leverages self-attention mechanisms for improved image classification performance.



## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Prepare the dataset .
3. Select the desired model architecture and modify training parameters as needed.
4. Train the model using the dataset.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and more.
